### Q: Where can I downlaod Discord Oxygen?
**A:** You can't. Its not released yet.

### Q: Will there be a free tier?
**A:** Yes, but it will be released later than the patron-only version.

### Q: Is Discord Oxygen Open Source?
**A:** I'd really like to open-source it, but unfortunatley I can't. There are several reasons I have to do this:
1. Discord could fix the exploits immediatley if they had the source code.
2. I don't want skids to copy it, I'd loose control over the code and skids would probably insert token loggers into the script.
3. If some exploits would fall into the wrong hands, many Communites and Servers could be destroyed. Just imagine what would happen if every Account gets hacked and every Server raided. That wouldn't be good for anyone.
4. I spend lots of time working on this project, I don't want some skids taking credit for my work

### Q: What data does Discord Oxygen collect?
**A:** The only data that will be stored is on what accounts a certain license is activated.<br>
It looks similar to this: `License xyz: 000000000000000000, 000000000000000000`.<br>
If more than the maximum allowed IDs register one a certain license key, the authentication will fail and the license key is deactivated.<br>
No other data is ever collected.

### Q: Are there any other undocumented features not included on this list?
**A:** Possibly. The patron-only version always receives the latest exploits, as soon as they are discovered. And the feature list already is really long, it just makes sense to not include every single Feature in the readme.
