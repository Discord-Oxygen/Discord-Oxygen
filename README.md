<h2>About</h2>
Discord Oxygen is a universal client modification with many features and includes every single hack <strong>I've created</strong>.

<h2>Important Information</h2>
<p>
  Many features listed here are only client sided!<br>
  This means that some things like a custom discriminator or animated profile picture/banner are <strong>only visible to other Discord Oxygen users!/strong><br>
  We try to make as many things globally visible as possible, but that's not possible for everything.<br>
  (For example the custom emojis are real emojis for Discord Oxygen-users, but for non Discord-Oxygen-users they only <strong>look like</strong> custom emojis.)<br>
  <strong>You won't get a real Discord Nitro subscription for free.</strong> Any tool claiming to do that is most likely a scam.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Important:</strong> Only use exploits on your own accounts or on accounts where you have the legal permission to do so. Hacking accounts is <strong>illegal</strong>, you will get in serious trouble if you don't have the permission. Please also consider that this wouldn't only be illegal but also unethical.

      <strong>
        * Allthough the Nitro generator is highly-efficient, its mathematically really unlikely that you get a code right.
        <br>(Also it would be kinda useless cuz DC Oxygen alr includes a nitro bypass)<br>

  <p><details><summary>This project is the continuation / result of my research on <a href="https://github.com/hxr404/Discord-Console-hacks">Discord Console Hacks</a>.</summary>
  The Discord Nitro script I made back then was fixed multiple times and I started a new project called the Framework. I included all Console Hacks and soon it began growing into something bigger. The Discord Server constantly grew (to over 500+ Members), some experienced devs joined us and we did some more research together.<br>
  But Discord didn't like it and soon the Server got deleted and every Staff Member banned. Discord is now "going after me", my exit nodes & proxies IP's are blacklisted and my public profiles are actively checked for Discord accounts to be banned. (No worries, I always find a way to create a new Account, I still have a bunch of alts.)<br>
  Thats when we decided to switch to Matrix, a open-source, decentralized, uncensorable and end-to-end encrypted Messaging Protocol. Its quite stable now, Anonymous and other Communities are hosted there.</details><br>
