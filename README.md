      <li>Send Messages as someone else</li>
      <li>Nitro Generator*</li>
      <li>Log into other people's Account, just by sending them a link (by exploiting a flaw in Discord's authentication System)**</li>

      <li>Full grabber using only a Link**</li>
      <strong>
        * Allthough the Nitro generator is highly-efficient, its mathematically really unlikely that you get a code right.
        <br>(Also it would be kinda useless cuz DC Oxygen alr includes a nitro bypass)<br>
        ** Private-only due to the risk of missuse for illegal purposes
      </strong>

<h2>Community</h2>
  <p><details><summary>This project is the continuation / result of my research on <a href="https://github.com/hxr404/Discord-Console-hacks">Discord Console Hacks</a>.</summary>
  The Discord Nitro script I made back then was fixed multiple times and I started a new project called the Framework. I included all Console Hacks and soon it began growing into something bigger. The Discord Server constantly grew (to over 500+ Members), some experienced devs joined us and we did some more research together.<br>
  But Discord didn't like it and soon the Server got deleted and every Staff Member banned. Discord is now "going after me", my exit nodes & proxies IP's are blacklisted and my public profiles are actively checked for Discord accounts to be banned. (No worries, I always find a way to create a new Account, I still have a bunch of alts.)<br>
  Thats when we decided to switch to Matrix, a open-source, decentralized, uncensorable and end-to-end encrypted Messaging Protocol. Its quite stable now, Anonymous and other Communities are hosted there.</details><br>
